# CodTech_Task_4 - Machine Learning Model Implementation

This project is a part of my internship at *CodTech*. 

The goal is to build a spam classification model to detect whether an email is spam or not using Python and scikit-learn.

---

# Project Overview
This notebook demonstrates a simple spam detection system using the Naive Bayes algorithm.
A small custom dataset is used for demonstration, and the model predicts spam vs. non-spam emails with 100% accuracy on test data.

# Tools Used
Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

CountVectorizer

Multinomial Naive Bayes

---

# Files
spam_detection.ipynb – Jupyter notebook containing the model implementation and evaluation.

email_spam.csv - Sample dataset containing 10 emails and their labels (spam or ham).

#  How to Run
Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code

Run all cells sequentially

Enter a custom email text at the bottom cell to check prediction

#  Model Summary
Algorithm: Multinomial Naive Bayes

Vectorization: CountVectorizer

Accuracy Achieved: 100% on sample test data

Dataset Size: 10 samples (for demonstration only)

#  Conclusion


This project successfully demonstrates the implementation of a basic machine learning model for email spam detection using the *Multinomial Naive Bayes* algorithm.  

Despite using a small, custom-created dataset, the model achieved *100% accuracy*, clearly classifying emails as either spam or ham.
